# ChatApplication using websockets (Nodejs, Express & Socket.io)
We are going to develop a chat application using Express, Websockets. Tough you can use plain websockets but we would be using a library called Socket.io - which is wrapper around Websockets, its super easy to use and provies a fallback to xhr requests until the websocket connection is established.

The frontend-ui is based on Flexbox, no external UI libraries are used, so you can modify it as per your liking.
